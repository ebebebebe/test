# Scope
This only covers the backend of the exam, and user need to play the application using the API documentation.

# Intro
This application was built using Java 17, Springboot 3, MySQL 8, and Docker to run everything in a single shell command.

I was able to cover a part of the junit tests, but I created those critical part of the application, on my own opinion.
